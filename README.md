# PyOS
A basic command line operating system written in python

# Running PyOS
You need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer for PyOS to work. You also need [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install the modules.

## Step 1
Open command prompt.

Then install the modules. Simple as using `pip install`.
```
pip install pyfiglet rich
```

## Step 2
Now you need to clone the project repo. There are 2 ways of doing this.

### Cloning directly from GitHub

Extract the files after the zip has been downloaded.

Then run this command:
```
cd PyOS-main
```

### Cloning using [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
```
git clone https://github.com/SpookyDervish/PyOS
```
Wait for it to finish cloning.

Then run this command:
```
cd PyOS
```

After cloning the project repo, proceed to step 3.

## Step 3
After these steps, you can now run PyOS. Run this command:
```
python pyos.py
```
That is it.
